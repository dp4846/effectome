In scripts/figures/figX are scripts that will generate the key figures in the effectome paper. 

pre-reqs: connections.csv and classifications.csv from https://codex.flywire.ai/api/download in the /data folder and then running /scripts/data/connectome_data.py to generate eigenvectors and other neccesary processing of data. In a few /figure folders there are some scripts with '_data' at the end of their name, these also need to be run to generate data for figures in that folder.
